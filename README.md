# Data Structures – Project

The project was prepared for the **Data Structures course project** at **Wrocław University of Science and Technology**. The goal of the project was the implementation and performance analysis of selected data structures in **C++**.

## Implemented Data Structures

1. **Singly Linked List**  
2. **Doubly Linked List**  
3. **Dynamic Array**
4. **Priority queue based on Heap**
5. **Priorty queue based on Doubly Linked List**
6. **Hash table based on Doubly Linked List**
7. **Hash table based on AVL tree**
8. **Hash table based on linear probing**

## Project Objectives

- Implement selected data structures from scratch in C++
- Measure the execution time of basic operations (insertion, deletion, search, etc.)
- Compare the performance of each structure
- Draw conclusions based on the obtained results

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-user/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o struktury
   ./struktury
   ```
## Potential improvements:

- support for .csv for results
- classes that implement data structures could implement shared abstract class thus reducing complexity and making tests easier
- unit tests for implemented data structures
- simplifying codebase responsible for measurements
